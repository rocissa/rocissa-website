The Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) is a not for profit business association comprised of information security professionals and practitioners. Members include practitioners at all levels of the security field in a broad range of industries, such as communications, education, healthcare, manufacturing, financial and government. The Rochester Chapter was the 101st official chapter of the international Information Systems Security Association.

The primary goal of the ISSA is to promote management practices that will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources. ISSA facilitates interaction and education to create a more successful environment for global information systems security and for the professionals involved.

Beginning in 2006, the Rochester ISSA members hosted the first annual Rochester Security Summit.  It is a community focal point for education and awareness in collaboration with higher education, business and industry partners, held during National Cyber Security Awareness Month. The Summit features speakers and panels providing education opportunities for executives, CFO, CIO/CSO, business managers, IT managers, security professionals, technical specialist and developers.
