We’ve heard for a long time how difficult it is for organizations to understand and prioritize cybersecurity risks. The ball is always in motion and it’s hard to stay focused. Unfortunately, the problem is getting worse, not better. This is the responsibility of cybersecurity practitioners, and we often miss the mark. We need to do better and partner with stakeholders to ensure that they have a solid grasp of cybersecurity and what needs to be done. 
 
It is often difficult to communicate cybersecurity vulnerabilities to stakeholders, quantify their impacts, and agree on risk mitigation strategies. A key necessity in resolving this challenge is to bring business and technical resources together to understand where business process, finance, and cybersecurity intersect. Without this collaboration it is nearly impossible to create alignment, understand impacts, and quantify risk that will result in meaningful change and action. 
 
Join Dan Didier and Paul Robinson as they work through a real-time cybersecurity risk management session to quantify impacts and prioritize cyber risk so that stakeholders can understand, communicate, and support cybersecurity at all levels. We'll demonstrate the following:

1.  Examples of how business, technical, and cybersecurity leaders must collaborate to quantify risk 
2.  Critical elements that must be part of a risk assessment to quantify risk 
3.  Creation of a prioritized risk mitigation strategy, supported by all stakeholders 
4.  Situations to avoid and what you must do to prevent gridlock 
5.  Two things to never do as a cybersecurity practitioner 
 
Dan and Paul bring decades of combined experience and goodwill in cybersecurity.
