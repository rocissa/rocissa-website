Join the Rochester ISSA chapter on September 16, 2025, from 2-6pm at RIT ESL Global Cybersecurity Institute's Cyber Range and Training Center for an immersive Ransomware Incident Response workshop. This hands-on workshop will thrust participants into a realistic ransomware scenario, challenging teams to make critical decisions when systems are locked and time is running out. You'll explore current ransomware trends, navigate third-party (insurance, legal, and media) considerations, develop and practice incident response playbooks.

The session combines tabletop exercises with practical blue team decision-making, giving you actionable strategies to protect your organization. Space is limited, so please register ASAP! You don’t want to miss out on this opportunity.
