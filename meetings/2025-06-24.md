As our organizations race to adopt as many AI capabilities as possible, it can be overwhelming as a Security team to sort out what the security considerations should be.  In this conversation we will dive into two specific Cybersecurity considerations of AI: protecting data when utilizing AI and how AI is shaping the malware landscape.  The goal of the conversation is for attendees to leave with a sense of what we can do now, and what to look for on the horizon in tackling these AI-related risks.
