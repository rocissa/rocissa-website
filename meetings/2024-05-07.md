Deepfakes are growing more sophisticated and realistic, and their potential for use in misinformation is clear, as they can be used to make anybody appear to say anything. At the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, deepfakes were used in war, as videos circulated of President Putin and President Zelensky each announcing their surrender. As these capabilities spread, it is critical that journalists and others have the tools they need to quickly and accurately assess such videos and determine if they have been manipulated. The DeFake project aims to develop and deploy a deepfake detection tool that is not only accurate but also usable by journalists and intelligence analysts in their workflow to help slow the spread of misinformation.
 
Matthew Wright, PhD, is Professor and Chair of Cybersecurity at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Dr. Wright earned his PhD in Computer Science at UMass Amherst in 2005 and previously worked as a faculty member in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington from 2005-2016. He is the winner of a NSF CAREER Award.
